# Diamond-Market-Modeling
Analyzed 50,000 observations to build and validate regression models predicting diamond prices in R
Addressed heteroscedasticity and nonlinear relationships using log–log transformations, improving model validity
Used ANOVA and AIC/BIC to select models, reducing overfitting while maintaining >98% explanatory power for pricing decisions
Identified severe multicollinearity using VIF and reduced model complexity significantly
Generated 95% confidence and prediction intervals to quantify pricing uncertainty for decision-making
